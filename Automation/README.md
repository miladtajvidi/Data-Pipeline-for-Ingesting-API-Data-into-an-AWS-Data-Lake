# 4. Automation

Automation is crucial for ensuring our data pipeline runs smoothly and without manual intervention. The main goal here is to automate the data ingestion, storage, validation, monitoring, and scaling processes.

## 4.1 Automating Data Ingestion with AWS Lambda

WS Lambda will be the core of our automated data ingestion process, fetching data from the Coinbase API and storing it in S3.

### 4.1.1 Deploying Lambda Function

* Uploading and deploying:
  * We can zip our Lambda function code and deploy it to AWS Lambda using:
    ```bash
    zip function.zip lambda_function.py
    aws lambda create-function --function-name CoinbaseDataIngestion \
    --zip-file fileb://function.zip --handler lambda_function.lambda_handler \
    --runtime python3.9 --role arn:aws:iam::your-account-id:role/your-lambda-role

    ```
  * Setting Environment Variables(Optional):
    * We can set environment variables like S3 bucket name, region, etc., for easier configuration:
      ```bash
      aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name CoinbaseDataIngestion \
      --environment Variables="{S3_BUCKET=my-bucket-name,REGION=us-west-2}"
      ```

### 4.1.2 Scheduling Lambda with CloudWatch Events

* Creating a CloudWatch Event Rule:
  * Schedule the Lambda function to run at our desired frequency (e.g., every 5 minutes):
    ```bash
      aws events put-rule --name CoinbaseDataIngestionRule \
    --schedule-expression "rate(5 minutes)"
    ```
  * Linking Lambda to the Event Rule:
    * Attaching the Lambda function to this rule so it triggers on the schedule:
      ```bash
        aws events put-targets --rule CoinbaseDataIngestionRule \
      --targets "Id"="1","Arn"="arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:your-account-id:function:CoinbaseDataIngestion"
      ```
    * Adding Necessary Permissions:
      * Ensuring that CloudWatch Events can invoke our Lambda function:
        ```bash
          aws lambda add-permission --function-name CoinbaseDataIngestion \
        --statement-id "AllowExecutionFromCloudWatch" \
        --action "lambda:InvokeFunction" \
        --principal events.amazonaws.com \
        --source-arn arn:aws:events:us-west-2:your-account-id:rule/CoinbaseDataIngestionRule
        ```

## 4.2 Automating Error Handling and Retries:

* Built-in Retries:
  * AWS Lambda automatically retries on certain errors. However, we have to ensure that our function logic includes retry mechanisms, especially for transient errors like rate limiting.
* Exponential Backoff:
  * We implement exponential backoff for retries within the Lambda function to handle API rate limits gracefully.
* CloudWatch Alarms:
  * We set up CloudWatch Alarms to monitor Lambda function failures or errors and notify us via SNS if something goes wrong:
    ```bash
      aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name "CoinbaseLambdaErrors" \
    --metric-name "Errors" --namespace "AWS/Lambda" \
    --statistic "Sum" --period 300 --threshold 1 \
    --comparison-operator "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold" \
    --dimensions "Name=FunctionName,Value=CoinbaseDataIngestion" \
    --evaluation-periods 1 --alarm-actions arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:your-account-id:your-sns-topic

    ```
## 4.3 Automating Data Validation

* In-Function Validation:
  * We implement data validation checks directly in the Lambda function to Ensure the data schema is correct and the data is complete before storing it in S3.
* Log Validation Failures:
  * We use CloudWatch Logs to record any validation errors, so we can audit and investigate issues.
* Alert on Validation Issues:
  * We set up CloudWatch Alarms based on logs to alert us if validation failures exceed a certain threshold.
 

## 4.4 Automating Monitoring

* CloudWatch Metrics:
  * Monitoring key Lambda metrics, such as invocation count, error count, duration, and throttling.
* Setting up Dashboards:
  * Using CloudWatch Dashboards to visualize the health and performance of our data pipeline in real-time.
* Automated Alerts:
  * Configuring SNS notifications to receive alerts on critical events, like repeated Lambda failures or S3 write errors.


## 4.5 Automating Scaling

* Lambda Auto-Scaling:
  * AWS Lambda scales automatically based on incoming requests. We need to ensure our Lambda function is optimized to handle this scaling, especially regarding memory and execution time.
* Data Partitioning in S3:
  * We have partitioned our data in S3 by time (e.g., year/month/day/hour) to handle large volumes of data efficiently. This will also make future data processing and querying more efficient.
* Using SQS for Buffering(Optional):
  * If our data ingestion rate spikes, we can consider using SQS as a buffer to manage data flow between the API and Lambda.

## 4.6 Automating Security Best Practices

* Rotating API Keys Automatically:
  * We can use AWS Secrets Managerâ€™s automatic rotation feature to rotate our Coinbase API keys regularly without manual intervention.
* S3 Bucket Policies:
  * We have implemented strict S3 bucket policies to control access and ensure that only the Lambda function and authorized users can read/write data.
* Encryption Management:
  * We can have all data in S3 is encrypted using AWS KMS, and monitor the usage of KMS keys to ensure compliance or like our case go with the default server-side encryption with Amazaon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).<br>
